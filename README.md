## 1. System Overview

The Mess Management System Backend Server provides a RESTful API for managing members, recording meal attendance, and generating monthly billing for members. The key features include:

- Authentication: Secure API endpoints using authentication to ensure data privacy and integrity.
- Member Management: Add, update, and remove members from the system.
- Attendance Tracking: Record attendance for lunch and dinner meals for each member.
- Expenses tracking: Record expenses for the mess.
- Billing System: Automatically generate monthly billing reports for each member based on their meal attendance. (Not implemented Yet)

## 2. Prerequisites

Before setting up the backend server, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Node.js: Install Node.js and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) (Node Package Manager) on your server. You can download them from nodejs.org.
- MongoDB: Set up a MongoDB database to store member data and attendance records. You can install MongoDB by following the instructions on mongodb.com.

## 3. Installation

1. Clone this repository to your server:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your/repo.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```sh
cd mess-management-backend
```

3. Install the required Node.js packages:

```sh
pnpm install
```

## 4. Configuration

Open the `.env` file in the project's root directory and configure the following settings:

- MongoDB Connection: Set the MongoDB connection string.
- JWT Secret: Set a secret key for JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication.
- Billing Settings: Configure billing calculation parameters, such as meal prices and billing cycle.

Example,

```sh
DB_URL="mongodb-uri-string"
JWT_SECRET="really-secret-key"
DEPLOY_HOOK="deploy web hook url"
DEPLOY_HOOK_DEV="deploy web hook url"
```

## 5. Running the Server

Start the backend server by running the following command:

```sh
pnpm run start
```

The server will start on the default port 3000. You can change the port in the config.js file if needed.
