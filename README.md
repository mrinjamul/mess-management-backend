- Billing System: Automatically generate monthly billing reports for each member based on their meal attendance. (Not implemented Yet)
- Authentication: Secure API endpoints using authentication to ensure data privacy and integrity.

## 2. Prerequisites

Before setting up the backend server, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Node.js: Install Node.js and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) (Node Package Manager) on your server. You can download them from nodejs.org.
- MongoDB: Set up a MongoDB database to store member data and attendance records. You can install MongoDB by following the instructions on mongodb.com.

## 3. Installation

1. Clone this repository to your server:

git clone https://github.com/your/repo.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```sh
cd mess-management-backend
```

3. Install the required Node.js packages:

```sh
pnpm install
```

## 4. Configuration

Open the `.env` file in the project's root directory and configure the following settings:

- MongoDB Connection: Set the MongoDB connection string.
